# Printing text on the screen

The function of f(x) equals x + 1. f(1) = 2. For Python, the function for printing something is print(...) which equals something you don't have to know to print text on the screen. Just be aware that you have to replace the ... with strings or something that holds a value. The following [file](hello.py) prints "Hello" in different ways.

```python

print('Hello World!')

```
